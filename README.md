# ESTATE FINDER

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Flask
- MySQL
- Docker


This project is in charge of making queries to a real estate database to show users the properties according to their status: pre-sale, for sale, and sold.

Users are able to filter the properties by: year of construction, city and state.

I've started to solve this problem by designing diagram with the best structure (according to me) for this microservice

After that, I have created the classes and methods that I will need, in the business logic structure, and finally, after having defined this aspect that I consider essential, I have moved on to create the directories and base files that constitute the project.
